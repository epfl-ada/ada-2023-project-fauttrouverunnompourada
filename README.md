# **ADAgency&trade;: Precision Casting Through Data Insight**

### Abstract

ADAgency&trade; is pleased to welcome you to their agency, where stars are born and dreams become reality. Our mission is very simple: making your wish come true by all means we can. Do you want to start a career to earn a lot of money in big blockbuster movies? Or is your dream to leave an eternal print on the 7th art? We can do all of that for you!

Indeed, in the current era of cinema, we would like to bring our insight in order to make informed decisions about casting for you. By filling a quick form on your identity, professional abilities and career goals, our cutting-edge algorithms will allow us to filter from thousands of potential auditions and find the most suited for you!

We eagerly anticipate your rise as the next ADAgency&trade; superstar!

### Research Questions

Throughout our research, we are trying to answer several questions:
- In a field as diverse as cinematography, how does one split a given set of information in order to evaluate our model in the most optimal way?
- How to best predict the financial/critical success of a specific production according to actor and movie-based variables?

### Additional datasets

Lately, the agency crawlers have worked to bring new information for our analysis. For now, the two additional datasets are:
- The user ratings of every movie from the IMDb website (at least every movie that had a rating). This will allow the agency to analyse the success of a movie based on two criteria: box-office revenue and critical acclaim.
- The awards won and award nominations of every movie, also from the IMDb website. This allows us to judge even better how a certain movie was received, not only by the public, but also by the industry.

We have also completed the box-office revenue data by grabbing from IMDb every revenue that was not previously there.

All of this scraping was made using the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

In the future, we also wish to collect additional movie and actor data that we have not used to train our model in order to get some testing data. We will probably use the [Cinemagoer](https://cinemagoer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to do so.
