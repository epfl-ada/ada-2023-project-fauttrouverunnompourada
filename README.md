[Welcome to]

### Research Questions

### Additional datasets

We have decided to extend the data that were provided to us in order to improve our analysis of the cinematographical landscape we are currently in and to offer you the best expertise on the market.

In addition to the gross revenue of movies, we decided to take into account their viewer-based ratings of the on IMDb website in order to judge their commercial success. Of course, your typical hollywoodian block-buster movie will generate a lot of money, but we are sure that you are not *only* money-driven and wish to leave your viewers satisfied. This is why we will also take these ratings into consideration when providing our expertise.
